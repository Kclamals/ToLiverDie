<!--    <b><span style='font-size:20.0pt;align=center;line-height:105%;font-family:"Monotype Corsiva"'><p>2LrD is a dynamic community of transplant patients formed by transplant patients for transplant patients. The community meets in an online video conference call weekly to share our experiences, discuss upcoming events, and provide support for each other. If you are a pre or post-transplant patient, or represent someone who is a transplant patient and are interested in our community, please use the QR code for more information or to sign up. We are not associated with AA or NA and are not sponsors nor intend to be. At meetings members are not required to speak and there is no roll call, members can join the conversation when they feel comfortable.</p></span></b>
